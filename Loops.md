# Loops - runs a block of code repeatedly until a set condition becomes false
### for-in Loop - used to iterate over a sequence (like a range, array, dictionary, or string).
```Swift
for item in sequence {
    // Code to execute for each item
}
  ```
#
### while Loop - repeats as long as a condition is true. Use it when the number of iterations is not predetermined.
```Swift
while condition {
    // Code to execute while the condition is true
}
```
